**Due: Monday, September 26 @ 11:59 PM**

Question 1: A linear regression model with ridge regularization was applied to the Diabetes dataset, which had been partitioned into training (70%) and test sets (30%). Using 5-fold cross-validation, the optimal regularization strength was determined, and the model's performance was evaluated on the test set. The coefficients and intercept were plotted, revealing that the body mass index (BMI) had the most significant influence on predicting disease progression one year after baseline.


Question 2: To solve Problem 2, the task was to estimate the average number of trips per hour for a taxi company in Downtown Gainesville using a Poisson distribution with a Gamma prior for the rate parameter 𝜆. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate for 𝜆 were computed based on 10 provided data samples. The analysis confirmed the Poisson-Gamma conjugacy, allowing for online updates of prior parameters with pseudo-code provided for the process. Using an initial guess for the prior parameters and updating them with incoming hourly data, plots were generated to visualize the estimated 𝜆 values via both MLE and MAP approaches, compared against the true value of 𝜆=10.
